But for that it's necessary to adapt to the new Discord implementations, so I ask you to use my slash commands! just type `/` and an interface will appear, click on my photo and you will see all my commands.\nIf this interface does not appear, you will need to re-add me on this server or ask a moderator to do this, just click [here]( https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=789123515882012683&permissions=1524649815287&scope=applications.commands%20bot).\nThanks for reading this, and hope to see you again using my commands! :D",
